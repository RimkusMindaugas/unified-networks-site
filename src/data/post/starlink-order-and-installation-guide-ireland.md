Thinking about getting Starlink? Good idea if fibre is still not ready at your address.

But here is the thing. Buying Starlink is the easy part. Installing it properly is where most people run into trouble.

If you want a clean professional install, see [Starlink installation and network integration](/services/starlink-installation-and-integration-dublin).

This guide walks you through the full process:

1. How to order
2. How to activate
3. How to install it in a way that actually works long term

## Step 1: Check if Starlink is available at your address

Before ordering, check your address on Starlink's availability map:

https://www.starlink.com/map

If service is available, you can order. If not, you may be able to join a waitlist depending on location and demand.

## Step 2: Order the right plan and hardware

For most homes, you are looking at the standard residential setup.

Starlink setup docs say the standard kit includes the dish, router, cables, and a kickstand.

Important point: the kickstand is fine for quick ground testing. It is not ideal for a permanent install.

That matters because your dish needs to be outside with clear sky view, while your router needs to be inside where your home Wi-Fi works best.

So yes, cable routing is part of the real install plan from day one.

## Step 3: Plan cable entry before the kit arrives

This gets missed all the time.

You need to get the dish cable into the house safely and cleanly. In most proper installs, that means creating a dedicated cable entry point through an outside wall.

Can you run a cable through a half-open window? Technically yes.

Should you do that long term? Usually no.

Problems with temporary window routing:

1. Water and drafts risk
2. Strain on cable/connectors
3. Window cannot close properly
4. Messy look
5. Easy for cables to be damaged

A clean wall entry with proper sealing is safer and more reliable.

## Step 4: Mount the dish properly (not just on the ground)

Starlink install guidance points people to permanent and elevated installation for better results, and that matches field experience.

Why mounting up high is usually better:

1. Better chance of clear sky view
2. Fewer obstructions from trees, roofs, and sheds
3. Lower risk of accidental damage
4. Less chance of people tripping over cable runs
5. Better protection from pets and garden activity

If you have dogs, ground-level cables are a chewing risk. And in some locations, exposed low cable runs can also be damaged by rodents.

So mounting higher is usually safer for equipment and more practical for day-to-day life.

## Step 5: Choose the right mount type

Most permanent installs use a bracket mount on the building.

If you are using an existing pole, Starlink's own mount videos point to a pipe/pole adapter for that setup.

In simple terms:

- Wall/roof edge install: use the correct Starlink bracket/mount
- Existing pole install: use the pipe adapter

Do not try to "make it fit" with random clamps and hope for the best. Dish alignment and stability matter.

## Step 6: Physical setup and first power-on

Once mounted and cabled:

1. Connect dish cable to router
2. Power on router
3. Connect to Starlink Wi-Fi network
4. Open the Starlink app and use the Alignment tool
5. Manually adjust dish direction until alignment looks good
6. Complete setup prompts in the app

Starlink's setup page confirms you can use the app to set up, and account activation can also be done online.

Quick note: the current Standard kit is software-assisted manual orienting. Auto-aim behavior was for actuated hardware generations, not the current fixed Standard dish.

## Step 7: Activate your account

If your service is not already active, go through activation in the app or at:

https://www.starlink.com/activate

You will need your account details and service location information. Follow the prompts, confirm plan details, and complete activation.

After that, set your Wi-Fi name and password.

## Step 8: Test signal and speed in real rooms

Do not stop at "internet works."

Test where you actually use it:

- Office
- Bedrooms
- TV areas
- Kitchen

You can have excellent Starlink to the house but still poor Wi-Fi in far rooms if internal Wi-Fi layout is weak.

If needed, add proper access points instead of relying on random extenders.

Our [Wi-Fi installation and setup service](/services/wifi-installation-and-setup-dublin) can handle this as part of the same project.

## Common mistakes to avoid

1. Leaving the dish on the kickstand permanently
2. Mounting too low where obstructions are obvious
3. Running cable through a window as a long-term solution
4. Skipping proper wall sealing at cable entry
5. Expecting one router location to cover every room perfectly

Fix those five and your setup will usually be far better.

## DIY or professional install?

If you are comfortable with drilling, sealing, mount alignment, and safe cable routing, DIY can work.

But many homeowners prefer professional installation for one reason: it is done once, cleanly, and properly.

A proper install usually means:

1. Better dish location
2. Safer cable entry
3. Cleaner finish
4. Better long-term reliability

And you avoid the classic "temporary setup that becomes permanent."
