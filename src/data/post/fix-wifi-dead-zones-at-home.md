Dead zones are usually caused by poor access point placement, wall materials, and channel interference.

Start with these checks:

1. Place the router in a central open area.
2. Avoid placing it near metal objects and appliances.
3. Split 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz only if older devices are struggling to roam correctly.
4. Run speed tests in multiple rooms and compare results.

If signal quality drops sharply between rooms, adding correctly placed access points is often more effective than buying a stronger single router.
