Choosing broadband used to be simple. You picked whatever was available and hoped for the best.

Now there are endless packages, flashy numbers, and upgrades that sound essential. It is easy to feel like you should just buy the biggest speed you can afford, because nobody wants not enough internet.

But for most homes, the right speed is not a mystery. It is about matching your package to how many people live in the house and what they do online.

Once you are in the right range, going higher usually brings smaller and smaller gains.

Below are realistic speed recommendations by household type. These are not lab numbers. They are speeds that feel comfortable in everyday life.

If you are still deciding between FTTH, cable, 5G, or Starlink at your address, read [Choosing the Right Broadband in Ireland](/choosing-right-broadband-in-ireland-urban-vs-rural/).

## Older people or light users

If internet is mostly browsing, email, WhatsApp, social media, and the odd video call, you do not need huge speed.

A good range here is **30-100 Mbps**.

That covers normal daily use and streaming on one TV without stress.

If you want a simple set-and-forget option, **100 Mbps** is usually comfortable for light usage.

## Typical home: two TVs, four phones, general usage (no work from home)

This is one of the most common patterns: streaming in the evenings, phones always online, kids on tablets, some gaming, and background app updates.

A good range is **150-300 Mbps**.

Most families feel comfortable in that range. If you want to avoid thinking about speed at all, **300 Mbps** is often the sweet spot.

## Young couple, heavy streaming, no remote work

Even without working from home, many couples use the internet heavily: streaming, music, social media, smart TVs, and occasional console gaming.

A good range is **150-300 Mbps**.

If you stream in high quality and use multiple devices at once most evenings, **300 Mbps** is a safe target.

## One person working from home (video calls, cloud apps)

Working from home does not usually need massive download speed, but it does need stability.

That is especially true for video calls.

A good range is **150-300 Mbps**.

Most people are very comfortable at **300 Mbps**, with enough headroom for everything else in the house.

## Two people working from home (calls + VPN + cloud)

If both adults work remotely, the goal is to keep things stable during busy hours.

A good range is **300-500 Mbps**.

Many homes do fine at **300 Mbps**, but **500 Mbps** can feel smoother if both are on calls while others are streaming or gaming.

## Remote work plus kids streaming/gaming at the same time

This is the "everything at once" household: calls, streaming, gaming, downloads, updates, and multiple people online during peak hours.

A good target is **500 Mbps**.

Lower speeds can work, but 500 Mbps reduces slowdowns when everyone is active together.

## Very heavy users (creators, large uploads, cloud backups, big file transfers)

If you regularly upload large files, do creative work, or rely on cloud backups, speed can make a noticeable difference, especially upload speed.

A good range is **500 Mbps to 1 Gbps**.

If this is occasional, 500 Mbps is usually enough.

If it is daily and time-sensitive, gigabit can be worth paying for.

## A quick rule for most homes

If you do not want to overthink it, use this:

- most homes: **150-300 Mbps**
- regular remote work homes: **300-500 Mbps**
- gigabit: mainly for frequent large file transfers or consistently heavy multi-user demand

## One final note before you upgrade

If your package already fits your household type but internet still feels inconsistent, the issue is often not the speed package.

It is usually local Wi-Fi performance where you actually use the connection.

In many homes, the fix is not buying more speed. It is improving coverage, placement, and signal consistency.
