Most people say "the internet is slow" when something feels off.

Sometimes that is true.
But sometimes the broadband is fine and the real problem is weak Wi-Fi in certain rooms.

If you do not test it properly, you can end up blaming the wrong thing and spending money in the wrong place.

This guide shows you a clean way to check:

1. What speed you are actually getting into the house.
2. How much speed drops from room to room.
3. Whether you have an ISP problem or a Wi-Fi coverage problem.

If you want an expert review after testing, our [internet and Wi-Fi troubleshooting service](/services/internet-and-wifi-troubleshooting-dublin) is designed for exactly this.

## Quick rule before we start

The best base test is a laptop connected by Ethernet cable to the router.

If you cannot do that, use your phone near the router. That is still useful.

And use the newest device in the house if you can. Older phones/laptops may have older Wi-Fi hardware and can show slower results than your network is actually capable of.

So if you test with a very old device, you might measure the device limit, not the network limit.

## Step 1: Take a base reading beside the router

Do this first. This is your reference point.

Best method:

1. Connect laptop to router with Ethernet cable.
2. Pause downloads, cloud sync, and streaming.
3. Run 3 tests and average the result.

No Ethernet available?

1. Stand beside the router.
2. Connect to the main Wi-Fi network (not guest).
3. Run 3 tests and average the result.

Write this down as your **Base Speed**.

Example:

- Test 1: 490 Mbps
- Test 2: 505 Mbps
- Test 3: 498 Mbps
- Base Speed: 498 Mbps average

## Step 2: Test room by room

Now move through the house and repeat the same test in key rooms:

- Main bedroom
- Home office
- Living room TV area
- Kitchen
- Far corner / upstairs landing
- Any garden office or outbuilding

Run 2 or 3 tests per room and average them.

Use this simple table:

| Room | Avg speed | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Router location (base) | 498 Mbps | Reference point |
| Living room | 430 Mbps | Usually strong |
| Main bedroom | 280 Mbps | Noticeable drop |
| Office | 190 Mbps | Likely weak coverage |

## Speed guide for common activities

Use this as a practical guide (rough values per stream/device):

| Activity | Typical speed needed | Notes |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Browsing and email | 1-3 Mbps | Usually light usage |
| Music streaming | 1-2 Mbps | Per active device |
| Video calls (HD) | 3-5 Mbps up/down | Upload matters a lot |
| HD streaming (Netflix, YouTube, IPTV) | 5-8 Mbps | Per TV/stream |
| 4K streaming (Netflix, YouTube, IPTV) | 15-25 Mbps | Per TV/stream |
| Cloud backup / large uploads | 20+ Mbps upload preferred | Can affect the whole home |
| Online gaming | 3-10 Mbps + low latency | Ping/stability matters more than raw speed |

IPTV quality can vary a lot by provider/feed. In Ireland people often call it a "dodgy box," and these streams can need more headroom than expected when quality shifts.

And the big one people miss: bandwidth is shared.

So even if one 4K stream works on paper, two TVs plus a video call can eat your available bandwidth quickly. Example: two 4K streams at ~20 Mbps each plus one HD call at 5 Mbps is already around 45 Mbps before anyone starts downloads.

## Step 3: Read the results the right way

This is where most people get clarity.

## If base speed is already very low

If your base reading near the router is much lower than expected, that points to an internet/ISP line issue, router issue, or package limitation.

In short: if the source is slow, every room will feel slow.

## If base speed is good but one or more rooms are much lower

That is usually a Wi-Fi coverage/layout issue.

Common signs:

- Big drops in one side of the house
- Upstairs much worse than downstairs
- One room always bad while others are fine

This points to wall/floor attenuation, poor router placement, channel congestion, or the need for access points.

That is usually where [Wi-Fi dead zone fixes and coverage improvement](/services/wifi-dead-zone-fixes-dublin) have the biggest impact.

## If results jump around a lot

That can be:

- Interference from nearby networks
- Busy household usage during test
- Older test device
- 2.4 GHz vs 5 GHz behavior

Retest at quieter times and compare again.

## Common testing mistakes (easy to avoid)

1. Testing while someone is streaming 4K or gaming.
2. Comparing one random test only.
3. Testing with an old device and assuming the network is the limit.
4. Standing in a doorway for one test and deep in a corner for another.
5. Switching between Wi-Fi networks during tests without noticing.

Keep tests consistent and results become much more useful.

## What to do after the test

Once you know where the problem is, action is simple:

## If base speed is poor

- Check your broadband package vs real results.
- Reboot ONT/router once and retest.
- Contact provider with your base test data.

## If base speed is good but room speeds are poor

- Move router to a better central location (if possible).
- Use wired backhaul and access points for larger homes.
- Avoid relying on random extenders as a long-term fix.
- For new builds, plan Cat6 and AP points before move-in.

## Final takeaway

Do not guess.

Take a clean base reading first, then test each room.

If speed is bad at the source, it is an internet-side issue.
If speed is good at the source but drops hard across the house, it is a Wi-Fi-side issue.

That one test flow saves a lot of wasted time and money.
