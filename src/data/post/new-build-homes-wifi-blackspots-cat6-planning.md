title: New Build Wi-Fi Is Harder Than It Looks (And What to Do Before You Move In)
excerpt: New build homes often have bad Wi-Fi in key rooms because modern materials block signal. Here is why one router usually fails, and how Cat6, access point planning, and a comms cabinet fix it.

You finally get the keys to your new home. Everything is clean, fresh, and done right.

Then the first week happens.

Netflix works in the kitchen, but the bedroom TV buffers. Your office call drops right when you are speaking. The kids say "the Wi-Fi is broken again," and you already know where this is going.

So you reboot the router. It works for a while. Then it starts again.

If this sounds familiar, you are not the only one. We see this all the time in new build homes.

And no, it does not mean your broadband provider is always the problem.

## Why new build homes get Wi-Fi blackspots

Here is the thing. New homes are built to keep heat in and drafts out. That is good for comfort and bills. But those same materials can weaken Wi-Fi signal.

Foil-backed insulation, dense walls, concrete floors, and modern glass all chip away at wireless signal strength. One wall is fine. Two walls and a floor later, your phone is hanging on for dear life.

That is why people say:

"My internet speed test is great beside the router, but rubbish in the room I actually use."

Both can be true.

The broadband line can be fast. The in-home Wi-Fi can still be poor.

## Why one router does not cut it anymore

A lot of people still think a single router should cover a whole house. That used to work better years ago when homes had fewer devices and lighter usage.

Now you have:

- Video calls in one room
- Streaming in another
- Phones everywhere
- Smart TVs and boxes
- Cameras and alarms
- Work devices
- Printers
- Maybe a garden office

One router in a plant room or hallway cannot serve all of that well in most new builds.

And adding random extenders is usually where things get messy. You might get a little more signal, but you also add roaming issues, odd dropouts, and more things to manage.

So yes, you can keep buying stronger routers. Or you can plan the house network properly once and stop playing Wi-Fi whack-a-mole.

## Plan Cat6 before you move in, not after

If you are building or buying a new build, Cat6 is one of the best upgrades you can make.

Do it early.

Once the house is finished and full of furniture, every cable run becomes harder, slower, and more expensive. You also end up with compromises that never look quite right.

Cat6 gives you a proper backbone. It lets you put Wi-Fi access points where they should be, not just where the broadband enters the house.

It also gives you stable wired links for devices that hate weak Wi-Fi, like:

- TVs
- TV boxes
- Desktop PCs
- Consoles
- Printers

And that reduces pressure on wireless for everything else.

People often ask if Cat6 is "worth it" in a house. In most new builds, yes. Very much yes.

It is like adding extra sockets while building. You may not use every run on day one, but you will be glad they are there later.

## Wi-Fi should be part of pre-move planning, like heating

Most people would never leave heating design until after move-in. But many people do that with Wi-Fi, even though the internet now runs work, school, TV, security, and daily life.

Network planning before move-in is not overkill. It is common sense.

A good pre-move plan means:

1. You know where your network gear will live.
2. Cables go in the right places once.
3. Access points are placed for real coverage.
4. You avoid ugly retrofit fixes later.

When this is done early, the house works from day one.

When it is not done early, you spend months saying, "Signal is grand in that corner, just stand there."

## Ceiling APs or socket APs?

This is a good question, and the answer is usually "both, in the right places."

### Ceiling-mounted APs

These are usually better for broad, even coverage. They are strong in open areas, upstairs landings, and spaces where lots of devices connect.

If you want smooth coverage across floors, ceiling APs are often the better base design.

### Socket APs (in-wall APs)

These replace an Ethernet outlet and give you Wi-Fi plus extra ports in the same unit.

They are useful in bedrooms, TV areas, and offices where you want local wired ports for:

- TV
- TV box
- Printer
- Docking station
- Small office equipment

They look clean and practical when planned properly.

So the real decision is not "which one is best forever." It is "which one fits each room."

Use ceiling APs for wide coverage.
Use socket APs where local ports and tidy setup matter.

Most strong home networks use a mix.

## Why a comms cabinet matters more than people think

A comms cabinet is where your network lives: fibre handoff, router, switch, patch panel, and related gear.

Without one, gear ends up scattered in random places. Then every change is harder than it should be.

With one, everything is tidy, labeled, and easy to manage.

It helps with:

1. Fault finding when something goes wrong.
2. Easy upgrades later.
3. Cleaner cable routing.
4. Better long-term reliability.

In plain terms, it saves time and stress.

If the house has proper Cat6 but no proper home for the network gear, you are still leaving value on the table.

## Plan for future upgrades now

Most homes add more connected systems over time. So do not only design for what you own today.

Think ahead for:

- Solar inverters
- Battery systems
- EV charger connectivity
- Extra cameras
- Smart home control
- Garden office links

One simple move that helps a lot later: run Cat6 to the attic.

Even if you do not use it right away, attic Cat6 gives you options for future APs, cameras, and extra runs with less disruption.

Future-you will be very happy with present-you for doing this.

## A realistic new build Wi-Fi checklist

Here is a quick checklist you can use with your builder, electrician, or network installer before move-in:

1. Pick a proper location for a comms cabinet that is accessible and ventilated.
2. Confirm where the broadband line will enter the house.
3. Run Cat6 to every room where people will work, stream, or use fixed devices.
4. Run at least one Cat6 to the attic for future upgrades.
5. Decide room by room: ceiling AP, socket AP, or both.
6. For socket AP rooms, confirm enough extra ports for TV, TV box, printer, and office gear.
7. Run Cat6 to camera points, alarm points, and any smart gate/intercom location.
8. Plan for future systems like solar, battery, and EV charger connectivity.
9. Label cable runs clearly in the comms cabinet.
10. Test coverage and roaming before the house is fully occupied.

That is the boring list that stops the boring problems.

## Final word

New build homes are great. But they can be tough on Wi-Fi signal because of how they are built.

So if you want strong, stable home Wi-Fi, treat it as infrastructure. Plan it early. Put Cat6 in the right places. Choose access points based on room use. Give the network a proper home in a comms cabinet.

Do that before move-in and life is easier.

Ignore it and the router reset button becomes part of your morning routine.
