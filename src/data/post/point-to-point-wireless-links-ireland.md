Need internet in a shed, yard office, workshop, or second building?

Most people assume they have two options:

1. dig a trench and run cable
2. use weak extender Wi-Fi and hope it works

There is a third option that often works very well: point-to-point wireless.

A [point-to-point wireless link](/services/point-to-point-wireless-links-dublin) can connect buildings with strong performance when cable runs are expensive or awkward.

## What point-to-point means

Point-to-point (PtP) is a direct wireless bridge between two locations.

One unit at building A.
One unit at building B.

They create a dedicated link between sites.

This is very different from a normal home extender.

Done right, PtP can be stable and fast enough for office work, cameras, VoIP, and regular business traffic.

## Where PtP makes sense in Ireland

Common use cases:

- house to garden office
- main office to warehouse unit
- farm house to outbuilding
- venue office to remote gate or ticket area
- business park units with clear line of sight

It is especially useful where trenching would involve major civil work or permissions.

## The key requirement: line of sight

PtP needs a clean path between both points.

Trees, buildings, and heavy obstruction can hurt link quality.

That is why proper site check comes first.

And yes, seasonal changes matter.

A link that looks clear in winter can get blocked by foliage in summer.

## How far can it go?

Distance depends on hardware, mounting, and environment.

For many business and property use cases, distances are well within practical range.

The real question is less "maximum distance" and more:

"Can we keep a clean, stable path for the bandwidth you need?"

That answer comes from survey and design, not guesswork.

## PtP vs trenching cable

### PtP advantages

- less disruption on site
- faster deployment in many cases
- no digging across roads or hard surfaces

### PtP trade-offs

- needs clear path
- weather and interference can affect marginal links
- mounting quality matters a lot

### Cabling advantages

- very predictable once installed
- great for permanent backbone where run is practical

### Cabling trade-offs

- cost and disruption can be high
- civil works can delay delivery

In many sites, the best answer is hybrid:

- PtP where trenching is painful
- cabling where routes are simple

If you also need wired backbone on site, [structured cabling services](/services/structured-cabling-cat6-cat6a-fibre-dublin) pair well with PtP.

## Real example

Client had a main office and detached workshop.

Old setup:

- workshop on weak Wi-Fi repeater
- frequent disconnects
- camera feeds unreliable

Fix:

- installed dedicated PtP bridge
- added local AP in workshop
- separated workshop devices cleanly

Result:

Stable link, cameras reliable, and staff stopped burning time on reconnecting devices.

## Planning checklist before installation

1. confirm line of sight from both points
2. check mounting options and height
3. define required speed for real usage
4. decide if remote side needs local Wi-Fi too
5. plan power and cable protection at both ends

Skipping these basics is where most bad installs start.

## Do you still need Wi-Fi inside the remote building?

Usually yes.

PtP gets internet to the remote building.

You often still need local Wi-Fi coverage there.

So many projects include:

- PtP bridge between buildings
- local AP setup on remote side

That is where [Wi-Fi installation and setup](/services/wifi-installation-and-setup-dublin) comes in.

## Security and management

A good PtP setup should include sensible security and clean network design.

Especially in business environments.

If the link is business-critical, ongoing checks matter too.

That is where a [managed Wi-Fi monthly plan](/services/managed-wifi-plan-monthly-dublin) can help keep performance steady over time.

## Is PtP good for temporary events?

Yes, in some cases.

For example, linking remote event zones where laying cable is not practical.

In temporary deployments, this is often part of a bigger event setup with priority traffic and backup internet planning.

See [event Wi-Fi setup and temporary broadband](/services/event-wifi-setup-and-rental-dublin) for that side.

## Final word

If you need connectivity between buildings, you do not always need to dig.

Point-to-point links can be a practical, stable solution when designed properly.

The key is site assessment, clean mounting, and realistic bandwidth planning.

If you need this in Dublin or surrounding areas, start with [point-to-point wireless links](/services/point-to-point-wireless-links-dublin) or [book a consultation](/#contact).
