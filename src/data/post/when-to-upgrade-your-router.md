Not every slow internet issue requires a new router. Confirm the bottleneck first.

Signs an upgrade is worth it:

1. Router is over five years old and cannot support current Wi-Fi standards.
2. Random dropouts happen even close to the router.
3. You have many smart devices and video calls but limited stability.
4. The router cannot handle coverage and throughput for your property size.

Before replacing hardware, test ISP speed at the modem and compare with Wi-Fi performance inside the building.
