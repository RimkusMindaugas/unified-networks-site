Starlink can deliver excellent connectivity when dish placement and internal distribution are done correctly.

Best practices:

1. Mount the dish with clear sky visibility and minimal obstructions.
2. Use quality cabling and weather protection for outdoor runs.
3. Distribute connectivity through managed access points rather than relying on one central hotspot.
4. Validate speed, latency, and stability from both wired and wireless clients.

For larger properties, network design matters as much as satellite signal quality.
